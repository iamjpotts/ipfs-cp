# IPFS File Copier

Proof-of-concept for copying mutable file system entries from one IPFS node to another, using Rust
and the Rust IPFS client library [rust-ipfs-api](https://github.com/ferristseng/rust-ipfs-api).

Can also download the mutable file system content of an IPFS server to a local folder.
